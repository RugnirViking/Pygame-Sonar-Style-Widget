# Pygame Sonar-Style-Widget

A simple little game where you have to guess sonar signatures from different types of sci-fi ships. Made to demostrate a sonar-style system.
It uses a base signal for each craft, adds some noise, then also adds an "artefact" to represent weirdness with temprature layers and seafloor features

I may never work on this again, but its here in case anyone needs that style of widget and wants to steal some of my code, although it is horrendous atm.
